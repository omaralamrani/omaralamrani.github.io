  <p>
As a user experience designer, it’s my mission to create an intuitive and delightful user experience in every step of the user’s journey. By constantly challenging myself in my design work, I keep up-to-date with new skills and technologies in interface design.<br />
<br />
My past experience as an architect helped me in making the transition into UX Design. Both roles focus on designing an experience for the user. Architecture is in the physical world while UX Design is in the digital world. However, I realized that continuing as an architect meant I would have little opportunity to directly engage with users. For this reason, I realized that User Experience Design is something I can truly enjoy as a long-life career.<br />
<br />
My strongest skill is User Interface Design, making the design intuitive and easy to learn for first time users. While I'm open to new opportunities, my past experience makes me a strong fit for UX Design role in e-commerce, branding & strategy or construction technology / transportation. More recently, I’m excited to see where design overlaps with new technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR).<br />
